# Continuous Integration

This project is a .NET application designed to manage and streamline various workflows with a focus on continuous integration (CI) practices. It automates the build, test, and deployment processes using GitHub Actions, ensuring that code changes are consistently tested and deployed with minimal manual intervention.

By setting up this CI pipeline, the project aims to solve the problem of inefficient manual testing and deployment. With automated workflows, it improves collaboration, speeds up development cycles, and ensures that every commit is thoroughly tested before being merged into the main branch. This approach reduces the risk of errors, promotes code quality, and makes the project easier to maintain over time.
